This is a positive example because it follows the pattern (x, 2x, 3x).

Hypothesis: (x, 2x, 3x)
There is no value of x that satisfies the pattern (x, 2x, 3x) for this sequence.

This is a negative example.

Feature Engineering: Select or create features that help improve model performance.
Modeling: Apply machine learning algorithms or statistical models to the data.
Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).
Deployment: Implement the model in a production environment.
Monitoring: Track the performance of the model over time and update it as needed.]
